Within this group, our application for Video Surveillance for Road Traffic Monitoring can be placed. We propose a solution based on machine learning and video analysis techniques that involves the whole process: database evaluation, background estimation, foreground segmentation, video stabilization and object tracking. As a result of this, our system will be able to monitorize some basic parameters of traffic flow as vehicles counting or speed estimation.\r\n\r\n#Links\r\n[Paper](https://www.overleaf.com/read/wthfdmywvkgr)\r\n[Slides]\r\n[Code](https://github.com/mcv-m4-video/Team7)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
